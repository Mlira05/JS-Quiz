# JavaScript-Quiz

A little quiz using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The quiz uses ratio inputs in a styled page to select answers to random questions and submitting it with button.

Using JavaScript, I was able to store the questions inside an Array of object containing (Questions, Options (a, b, c and d) and its respective correct answer.

All the logic is based on checking the received choice from the user, updating the score if necessary and printing out the final result.
